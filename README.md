#### React Expense Tracker 

This is a project material from the udemy course : React - The Complete Guide of Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. His comprehensive teaching helped me a lot.

From this project, I've learned:

- react basics and components
- state, event handling
- rendering lists and conditional content exposure
- child-to-parent component communication
